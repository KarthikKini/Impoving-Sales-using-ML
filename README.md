Improved the sales for an Edtech firm from 30% to 80% 

The edtech firm was facing an issue in their sales department wherein they were getting many people on their website but were not able to convert these people into Students.
I identified the most important features by EDA after data cleaning .Atlast a model was built which will now help the sales team to identify the customers who have more probability
of getting converted into a student based on lead score assigned to them .Higher the lead score higher are the chances!
